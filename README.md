## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

Through this project, I solidified my understanding of creating responsive layouts and how to effectively use Flexbox for centering and aligning content. Here are some key takeaways:

1. **CSS Grid vs Flexbox**: I learned when to use Flexbox for simple layouts and when a CSS Grid would be more appropriate. Flexbox worked well for aligning the QR code and the text, but I also considered the power of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
2. **Mobile-First Approach**: By designing for mobile first, I ensured that the component is easily viewable on smaller screens. I leveraged `@media` queries to make the design responsive for larger screens.

Example of using Flexbox to center the content:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

1. **Improving Accessibility**: I aim to ensure that all components I build are fully accessible. This includes adding more ARIA attributes and ensuring proper keyboard navigation.

2. **Enhancing Layouts**: I plan to explore more advanced layout techniques using CSS Grid for more complex designs.
